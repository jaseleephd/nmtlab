Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar.
In future, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also contains "unvised texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects that were radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the auditor for examinations, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new notification system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the GCSEs would become more “demanding, more ambitious, and rigorous.
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time for math in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math examination, combined with a greater emphasis on the subject in rankings, will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on “problems from the right life,” including financial mathematics.
Rapeers in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced twice for life on Friday.
This was reported by the station SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had provoked disgust throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors struggled for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of young people was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Cana had admitted during the trial that in fact had been in a bar with Booysen.
He also confessed having beaten and raped her, but he confessed being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police initially had several offenders, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not enough.
The Prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that at the time of the attack, Cana was alone.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64 000 advertisements every year for sexual violence.
This is nearly ten times the number of people in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has considerably more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, the police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence by 10 to 25 times.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is regarded as a lovely chewing because he has set himself the goal of taking part in a race in America with his motorcycle, the year 1920.

Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator keeps his customers in breath.
The trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of the German period.
In a communication the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two panics in one week alone.
First, US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent massively erroneous purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to watch and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the total U.S. equity trading was suspended for several hours due to a computer flap at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
In addition, last year’s Facebook Stock Exchange was a source of excitement.
The Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established SEC stock exchange supervision, and dubbed the company to a record fine of $10 million.
The secret service enclave Edward Snowden is generally prepared to talk to the German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants to be clear about his situation.
The former NSA employee, sought by the US, made this clear in a non-addressed letter that Greens-European Free Alliance politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday following a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the German Bundestag and the German Attorney General.
The letter has the following wording after a translation widely used by the transcription:
To those responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your mass surveillance inquiry.
I was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed by a contract or by direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In my work in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic infringements of the law of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have been exposed to a serious and persistent strain that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spying revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed misuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of fidelity and strives to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this damaging attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law, which protects us all.
Edward Snowden is testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele.
Drivers who had been drunk with 210 km/h and a hot drink between their legs will receive a £1000 penalty.
A car driver was fined £1,000 because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage tray between his legs.
Howie was guilty before the Colchester court of office without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He was awarded seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 surcharge.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game hacks with machined.
Two children admitted in Uruguay the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys invited their victim to go on bird hunting with them.
On Tuesday, they armed the 11-year-olds with craftsmen and knives and took the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The corpse was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive resort Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year semi-sister who took them with him should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described before the police the crime without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called among other things a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
The Government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syrian air force base.
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news station, CNN, that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia.
The aim was ' rockets and associated equipment', which the Israeli Government feared had been destined for Lebanese Hizbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Al-Arabiya Arab broadcaster, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot dead on Thursday night, and blamed the Israelis for that.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a SA-3 missiles battery could be seen, with channels 2 being blown up to a range of 35 kilometers.
Uncertainty The Government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an Israeli government official who is also anonymous in saying that he believes that Israel has executed the attack, but is not certain.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: 'We do not comment on these reports'.
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, the journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had already tried, and in part successfully, to supply ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hizbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means crossing a 'red line' that would follow a military response.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care.
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to become the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father's loss of consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation emerged that spread to his brain and created a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgicals in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It is not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first, and it is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, in the United States the relationship is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle, the decision to take action was ripened.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels at weekends to rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people hang in minibuses and travel through untreated terrain to the villages in need of help with the hidden medical equipment on the roof.
Things are not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to drive their vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to participate in the happy celebrations.
The next morning the team will then start investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per journey,” says Bwelle.
You come from a 60 km radius around the village – and that is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The illumination for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It's a tough pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“You are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
Last year, the group – a mix of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a nest break he received is now possible for him to work again.
"This is changing the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and voluntarily collaborates in Bwelle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be there in operations where we can help to absorb blood or consider the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” says O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring with them often donated medical material.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no bounds.
For bwave, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father gives him great pleasure.
“I am so happy when I do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February.
On 22 February, Pope Francis will be calling for the first new Catholic church kardins, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Kardins are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also those who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately succeed in the election of his successor.
At present there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal reaching an age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope’s election – a group of 120 “electoral cardinals.”
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new kardinsis is held, which is also known as.
“Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected kardins would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of selectable cardinals would go back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year's consistortion is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The kardins will also be the first to have been appointed since the formation of the Council of Kardins founded by Francis, a group of eight Kardins from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight Kardins to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “well possible” that Francis would ask the Kardins for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called to cardinals, but Franziscus dressed up “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s reaping”.
Workers crashed from ladder: seriously injured.
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a head and injured hard.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heater at the exterior facade of an inn.
As he climbed to the ladder leaning on the roof she slipped away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the provincial hospital of Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Is Europe’s elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy, representing roughly British company sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while EU states are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil to be favored by the government, rather than with the long and strenuous process of reforming the EU’s obscure institutions.
In their view, the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster on specific legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, because, according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40% of large companies agreed that were traditionally the most pro-European.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our consultation with economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a path to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pressing for a “meaning change” that brings the act back to Britain.
There is much to be said about it – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of keeping the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone is now moving towards a tighter economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the outcome of our survey shows, which means for businesses a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.

Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism.
At the Mecklenburg Lake District a pilot project for the tourism industry is starting.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified to become professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New about this is that the six-month courses end with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert from the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: it would not make the participants unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat back.
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks in 2014 to solve a problem with the manual seat backrest, according to a US car safety announcement.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for placing the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“If the head restraint is pushed up from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants so that there is a higher risk of injury," was reported on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.
The models recalled were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and is the most important model launch of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvent restructuring in 2009.
In the first half of October, GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect.
Due to the 16-day government shutdown, the NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on auto sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, has increased by 20% in the first ten months of the year, GM declared on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra kickup trucks.
The GM stock rose by 1.4% to USD 37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Mother in the forest is spared and pensioned.
When his mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to earn their pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations in order to be able to continue collecting pension and care.
First of all, he has covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he has cut the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected back in May: at that time it was striking that the mother in need of care was no longer in need of medicines.
The detainees told the investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was odd for officials, they continued to determine.
It was discovered that for more than 15 years the two had lived in a common home and he had last cared for it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, obduction did not provide evidence of a capital crime.

Highlander games at the Kaltenhof.
In addition to the braking truck pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn festivities at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander games will start at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they have a Swede in the Cold Court.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunks, horseshoe throws and water buckets.
Four and a half meters the tree trunk is long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't come to the farther," says organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown out vertically, be overwhelmed and then be lying.
This is assessed with most of the points.
In the case of horseshoe throwing, it is important to be precise.
From eight metres away, a gate is thrown.
Skills and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the trapping of water above 50 meters.
Time and quantity of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team two will be allowed to participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can start your training from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is required, for example, the players can play in the Scots Rock.
But also Swabian costume is permitted.
For the "outfit" the jury will issue a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the Traktor Pulling, which begins half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action to be done on the festive grounds on Saturday.
In the evenings, the bladder musicians get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the Burmeseabeohmic brass music from Schömberg is a great evening of entertainment.
The chapel was played by Polkas and Marsh.
Her repertoire also includes emotional reels and a rich big-band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black whirl baron, will be part of it.
He has already appeared in Dornhan at the Christmas market and in the Christmas Market.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten is holding for early kicks, from 2 p.m. the farm chapel Bopeningen is a guest, and the "Oldies" will end the festival.
The Stopelacker Party with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Twisting Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsmen's market and the sheep's shepherd.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw-shockburg, tractor driving (under guidance) and Traktor-Surfing.
The organisers are the multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Kenyan press outrages about controversial media law.
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper that considers the draft law unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Capital Group CEO, one of Kenya’s most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites, including CapitalFM.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the government is using the new law to effectively hack the media into a grip, whereas The Standard, Democracy, and Freedom of Speaker writes in Kenya would have suffered a heavy blow, and titled the draft as “draconical.”
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the attack by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media caught up with the anger of the authorities for publishing pictures of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by calling two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the premia for a media outcry was withdrawn.
According to the new law, media houses can be fined by up to 20 million Kenyan schillings, and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what they describe as “lived blogosphere” in Kenya.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
"No one will ever know it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a nation-based journalist, who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
“Let politicians be left to themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy, and return to the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
Kenyan legislators have been in public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their fat salaries of around 532,000 schillings per month – one of the world’s highest.
2014 will be the Geisinger Festjahr.
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
A return of the first written mention is approaching.
When the year ends in just over eight weeks, the jubilee year is due.
In 794, the first mention was made of geniuses and church houses.
A document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since the Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this opening event will take place in the place where, 1250 years ago, both were first mentioned in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and Church Houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Come back and celebrate.
On Friday with a festive ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festive event around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this festive weekend there is also the Church Hausener Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21, together with the Sonnwend celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year, the official date is the last weekend of September, 27th and 28th September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new chronicle is also released.
"It should become a chronicle not only of the Geatings themselves, but a printed work on the branding of today, which is made up of ancestors, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen.
And today’s branding is also celebrating 2014, and today’s space was inaugurated in 1974.
The new Chronik will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
The Narren Zunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom-made evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the festivity on 29th March and from 1st to 4th May.
The Altewerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisingerschule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Music Association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will celebrate 150 years of age and from July 4th.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses) which was then court.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
To celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
This year, a Hubertus fair will be celebrated on the name day of St. Marien in the parish church of St. Marien at the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the saga of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted through a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhorn brass group of Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is performing on parforce listeners (nature listeners in the mood Es) according to old, original French melodies.
The glasses wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riding horses, horses and dogs on trawls.
The festive trade fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
Supreme Court confirms Obama’s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s single mandate – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
The supreme judge, John Roberts, sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining passages of the 2700-page law, and also argued that the provision of the health law that states would either have to extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise would not have to suspend all government medicaid.
The lawsuit had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all of the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Lucky the Dreaming Kamel
Luckily is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed.
The first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Händes".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which has already had considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported extensively about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouak Schottenhaus.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site during several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the inserts were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the jubilee event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Car.
Rainer Prewo, the former Nagold OB, had proposed providing this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to operate in an advisory role at the club, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Schleeeh room from Baiersbronn in the record time of just under a week created the sickbay in Socogim, an area of misery on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouak Schotten.
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be phased out in Nagold.
A lot is learned in Africa as a medical practitioner, Henne argues, for example, de accelerating against burnout.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many medical doctors came to Germany to hospitate in various areas.
In addition, containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, association material, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local dialects by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes cars converted into a mobile goat stable and the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the club's journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he became aware of how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy is also demanding global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old stone wall as the front boundary of the old school courtyard before the reconstruction to the church street is to be put back on the reconstruction cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built with balustrade in the first works of the reconstruction of the former schoolyard to stabilize and reduce the static discharge of the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall.
The next step is to involve the regional monument office in planning, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, and to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table to the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the refurbishment, paving and planting of the old school inn at the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future, the refurbishment must be put on a new foundation stone.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old school courtyard to the church street is mainly caused by water and frost damage, because there is no drainage, need remediation and has a bow grading forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using the school courtyard, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the refurbishment was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses caused a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall reconstruction, which has even been used for filming, will be the National Monument Office.
In the case of requirements coming from this site, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the memorial protectors.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport.
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter that the protector was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A securityman has also been killed.
The media also reported a number of injured.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed of the situation, said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 eye witnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveller told CNN that many people had been looking for panic protection.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
There was panic among the waiting people, many of them were hiding behind chairs for fear.
He has heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A security officer TSA has suffered a shot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that he had been brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a safety control area.
Airport Buildings evacuated
On television screens, we saw a number of nurses and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people have been brought into safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a grounded gun.
As the airport management told via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backwards.
It was said that air traffic had been temporarily suspended until landings.
However, on CNN several planes were also visible at the start.
Terminal 3 is served mainly by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport in Los Angeles is one of the largest airport in the United States.
Gutach: More safety for pedestrians.
They are not 100 metres from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall ramps.
Two plants so close to each other: intentional or adornment?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
"The City Hallampel was installed then because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The facility officially opened yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be brought in for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the district councillor Offenburg.
"In recent measurements on the B 33 approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the town of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going ahead here", says Arnold.
In total, four traffic shows had been carried out, and a roundabout was also thought about, but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossroads.
As Arnold said, everything was tested before at the location of the traffic light masts: "With a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks, we tested whether these vehicles could be driven from the Sulzbachweg to the 33.
The traffic light system itself, which costs around EUR 15 000, is "the most up-to-date what is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that brighten up so powerfully that the lights of the motorists are well known, for example, even in low-lying suns.
It is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light installations per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technique of the new facility: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks if the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or partially sighted people go through the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safe through the railway," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think about this as a partner and watch the runway.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green, a top-class vehicle noised through - with bright red.
Longer breath pays off
Six men’s teams fought for the title of the winner in the club’s tennis tournament.
In the end, the stamina of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The Tennis Department of Sportfriend Rohrdorf had received a dream bet for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team, each playing against everyone.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament.
The tournament management was in the tried and tested hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were in the same position as Michael Cliffl and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to hand over the Hiking Cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael cliffl/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier reached the Bronze Step of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the tournament was well finished.
Birds saved by air rescue service from North Sea-Bohr Island released.
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released into nature.
The water coral was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was sealed up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: 'This water troll was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe, which was held up by the strong winds over the North Sea.'
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: 'He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help'.
When they were released, the water torrent was once again fit and healthy.
Discovers drug tunnels with its own railway between the US and Mexico.
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation, and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide drug-laden lorries.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported in it unrecognisably, the authorities declared.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as a driver, were charged with the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and life-long in the event of a sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Centralmexiko in October, which poses the challenge for the drug cartels to bring their product quickly to the consumer.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of almost 640 metres long with rails that ran from a kitchen in a dwelling house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "certainness test".
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with 457 visa as part of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, it will be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labor Party MP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers, because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Strengthening statements such as “foreigners to set up at the back,” and “the Australian first,” are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions were demanding a protected labor market,” she told the Australia Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region had an echo of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once thought of by former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the proposed changes and the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is accepted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company" or personally.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have ended up shutting down hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week on the Christmas island with a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been supervised by an adult cousin on Wednesday since his father’s death.
The Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian town with giant mirrors lights.
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their bleak valley.
Due to the low temperature of the sun, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a dream of a century became reality on Wednesday.
"Endlich!", mayor Steinar Bergsland fired at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some valley residents were able to cope with sun chairs and others set up sunglasses for safety.
Until now, the sun-hungry people have had to go to a nearby summit by cable car in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the beams with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the expensive project of 5 million kroner (about EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine for the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The working group responsible met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, Members' reception and the federal police.
This morning, the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
One of the issues I think will be the subject of dual citizenship, on which both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants to put an end to the compulsion of immigrants born in Germany to choose one - the Union refuses to accept a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD reinforced its 'no' to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette was a "Flatrate for multi-experience and therefore ecologically counterproductive," declared the SPD negotiator for the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a risk of drifting off roads, which are already the priority areas for accidents.
The introduction of tolls for all cars would also be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later date," he said.
Suggested Pieps disturbs residents.
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships onto the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at its location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the drain.
Two huge blue dumplings and back-loaders distribute or load the coal here as required.
Every movement of the envelopes kills a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of unfavorable winds, this is a lot to be heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the town.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to count on open dialogue with its neighbours.
For Matthias Schrell has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the great in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 metre long sun lounger in front of the terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be used here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million ton mark on the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez plant goes to the network, then 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship-loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer.
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The town has sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private individual.
The local council agreed to the sale in a non-public part of its recent meeting.
The building changed its owner at a "appropriate" price.
"The town is satisfied", says Maier.
EUR 100 000 was earmarked in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The Mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter, and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, how to heat, look to the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is delighted.
Halloween 2013: in numbers.
When I was small, Halloween had some magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become a Halloween mutoon.
Over the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute sweets from my home, and I am sure I will not do so this year either.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween again are the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are Zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone, to my amazement.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year on domestic pet costumes, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not foolish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of stools, lynxes, candies and rubber buckles.
So good news for the US Department of Trade for 41 million people who move through the district with the slogan “Sweet or Saures.”
In fact, we are going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let us not fool ourselves, we will eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion maize crops.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spukt.
They have great names such as “terrorism Behind the Walls” (which is, by the way, in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spuk houses in the United States that earn $500 million, so America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are just shooting in the pants, and then you are shooting the friends.
But let us finally come to the pillows.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kürbis when we were children, and caring for a pumpkin lamb is like the tingling of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend began only last year thanks to P Remember, so most of us have grown up with the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumping, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lanterns, which are slowly breaking down in the foreground, are presumably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something bad from their 921 kilogram pumpkin.
Pimps must be in prison.
Due to exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous injury, the District Court of Konstanz has condemned a 33-year-old St. Georgen man to three and a half years' imprisonment.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, dismissed a confession as part of a process consultation.
Thus, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks, against their will.
He used resistance to break with violence and threats.
He kept the income of women, who in some cases raised for years for him,.
By assembling mobile phones and SIM cards, he underwent contacts of women with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he brought them to various brothels in the south-west.
In that case, he has partly supervised them to control their revenue.
At the court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering under a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric Expert hinted at deep doubts about mental restriction and thus a limited guilt, the 33-year-old lay down a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the women who were damaged.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after an initial advertisement.
The interrogated talks were marked by high aggression.
In subsequent interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another stuff in which one of the women had discovered blue stains on the whole body has not yet made any statement.
It was 'a completely broken personality', which regarded violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has dissolved from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after being detained," he said.
Tripodi denies that he had been influenced by Obeid.
An investigation is under way by the State Corruption Supervisor against former Labor Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW Minister denies that, at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, the rules on marital contempt have been amended, who had hidden holdings in three lands in state-controlled lands.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC - Independent Commission Against Corruption) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state, lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two.
Now it is being investigated because of the accusation that Tripodi knew about obeid's hidden interest in the plots, after Tripodis had declared the former deputy tribe Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday.
In many years of talks, which began in 2005, the government pressed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The Guardians were against this and also wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the lease contracts for companies at the Circular Quay, which earned the obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who served as the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of public tenders.
But he resigned to make the changes at Obeid’s request, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a reform of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone booklet presented to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under the Fisheries Authority.
"Why was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations about the development of the commercial rules of contempt?", the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia because of state surveillance.
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
At the instruction of the Federal Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism Office (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the US external office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas, and the action led to a change of word between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies, or to increase their international competitiveness."
But, since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, has begun publishing his horn of American surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders have not been sure that they can take the lead.
Reports that the American National Security Agency spyed out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new level because of state surveillance.
The cop-out brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s telephone was blurred, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate leaders are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US was now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published by EY in July.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden have not yet shown that the US has passed the business secrets of foreign companies on to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet capabilities and reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
“This does not work,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If a strong European IT industry had been wanted, it should not have been let out 20 years ago.
All in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Yet the range and technical refinement of US spying authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud Computing is changing significantly, as European corporate leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and are potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, according to revelations about US data-mining activities with prism, about 10% of non-United States member plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, vice-president of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area?”
Many German corporate leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That has always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF’s chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance normally does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that provides benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been declaring that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unguarded refilling a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been a standard practice to collect cell phones before a meeting of the board so that they cannot be used as an eavesdropper.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
Prepaid cell phones are subsequently thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” says BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel among China two of the countries that served to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of directors of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French were the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the French Internal Secret Service, DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are all their allies.
When the horse show experts arrived in Cardiff to capture the horse of the year, they knew that there was a tough competition.
But none was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and took his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffeeee simply swept through the three rounds and won the first prize – with the age of 30.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition organised by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his percussion in a fright angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to deal with ponies, which far exceed his age.
And Toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then has been with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: 'Fenton and Toffee are a great ghost'.
They had to compete against the whole contest and went out of the place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all delighted when he won.
A lot of strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than ten years.
Howell's saying: 'The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired and cried it'.
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand, and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is mad to animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
As it started, it will not take long until it is on the “Pferd of the Year” show – and I am sure it will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: 'Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his ponie'.
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffeee according to how well they had beaten and presented in the show ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between ponies and leaders – and here Fenton and Toffeee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton’s sweet dress has played its part, that really fits perfectly to the occasion.
A day of care at the little English cottage.
For the fifth day of care in succession to the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view of the valley should be cut off on that day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the splendor of the gorges, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for strengthening the link between people and nature.
It gives every citizen the opportunity to set the accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect can also take account of the environment.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Conservation of the Governing Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful.
According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the foresight is to preserve the now highly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing willows.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free links to the conservation of art.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss out on breaking a gun for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous nursing days for the future.
After these various speeches, the residential chief Christoph Wehle and Life-project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, and the forest tractor may be available.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone cone.
The aim was to have a free view at the vantage point.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music.
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors to coffee, cake and then a vesper.
In the past, the elderly people were served in the resting place.
In the meantime this afternoon is taking place in the nursing house of St. Joseph.
Home dwellers were looking forward to the delicious cakes and tarts.
Later there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich maintained.
Kingsfeld: Small team beats in a waistcoat.
The volunteer fire brigade handled its autumn test with flying colours, despite a lack of personnel.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Head of department Hans Kammerer had chosen Feder farm in Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
A short cut is supposed to have been made during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two respiratory guards of the Wehrmacht were prepared to enter the building after Hans Kammerer's first examination of the situation.
After a short time, he was able to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy as it was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electric machines for wood processing.
The first emergency attack took place through the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was over a flood hydrant about 100 meters away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise of showing what can be done with little available staff.
In case of emergency, support will be provided through the daily intervention group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Iran’s Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN NATO powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to overcome the differences of recent years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
There is still a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiating process and is also optimistic that, in the end, both sides will come to a solution.
Rescue Package of $325 million Australian dollars for Tasman Healthcare.
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the bailout package of over $325 million Australian dollars for the Tasman health system to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth will take “in short-term measures” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after consultation with the independent Tasman MEP, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek explained today.
The $325 million package represents $31 million of emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and grey star treatment, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-care after in-patients, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“This investment is in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they were the best way to improve the Tasman health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Taiwanese Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that put Taiwan’s public health system on a more sustainable path.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these electoral achievements will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the federal opposition’s health-policy spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is only a “broadcasting solution.”
“We are in today’s position because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to pull almost half a billion dollars out of the system and for the Commonwealth to put 300 million into it and then act as if that were good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
French football will indeed take the first strike since 1972 in protest against the proposed Reich tax.
A conciliation meeting has come to an end without results.
The French government and the professional football team have managed to reach a dead end following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the association and association at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % levy on income of more than a million euros per year, which all the firms in the country are due to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike, announced at the end of November, will now also be taken through, with the head of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, which are scheduled between 29 November and 2 December, will therefore lapse.
Words come from the Bible.
More than 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the Municipal House was "Let's Words from the Bible" and "Developments from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the parish council, gave a presentation on the biblical words after breakfast.
"Let's talk about life's wisdoms, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words with the corresponding bible and explained the meaning.
She called slogans like: Wooden Eyes are watchful, how sheds fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who gives Hiss in sleep to wash his hands innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her audiences what the saying was.
The medieval expressions of the Church Council of the Church of Christel Dehner took on board: all the good things are three, blue, something hated.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called 'bridges to the past'.
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were written humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round were also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
He could be called the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Astounding the kinship on the outside: the sneaking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski can be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is widely regarded in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousandins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security obsession, and the belief that to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He has realised, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creation.
This is the 'Blade Runner' problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The 'minority report' dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunal.
The principle of 'pre-crime' is being developed here, 'Pre-Crime', that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
"We capture individuals who have not infringed any law," says the head of the authority.
'We snatch them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, we have a criminal camp full of pesudover-breakers for that.
They assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick’s story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA’s eavesdrop.
Anticipation of the attack: this is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not yet over.
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers, the military controls daily life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be supervised and a future crime will be carried out.
The system is running through.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own conditions.
Do not just accept mistakes and sacrifices, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth time and time again.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive.
On Thursday, a Federal Appeal Court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop and Frisk programme (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and took the judge out of the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shirascheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken to appeal to the city.
In August, the judge had ruled that the city was in breach of the Constitution by the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments about the request for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be lifted from the case, since she had violated the Code of Conduct for American judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly due to a number of media interviews.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men with the stop and risk programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-driven cameras in districts where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police checks.
An oral negotiation to appeal to the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-risk tactics have been criticised by a number of citizens' rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks during the Non-Party Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s term of office has risen to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004 four men, who belonged to all minorities, were brought to court, which became a collective action.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police officers use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police, but not crime; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure following the disappearance of thousands of posts over the last decade would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and risk practice that was constitutional, but only reform the way in which the NYPD controls were implemented.
Wrath about Judgement for Bombers in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002, were angry at the judgment for the last of the instigators who were brought to justice, because Umar Patek was supposed to stand up.
Patek, who had been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after persons of Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
An appeal was also made in a series of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The Prosecutor called for a life-long sentence, even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also called "demlition man' .
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother of Perth who created their 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny, who lost almost ten years ago by Patek and his conspirators.
With tears, she said that Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other trolls.
"You should put him in front of a shooting squad," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters any more.
The Sari Club was put on the ground when a massive bomb exploded shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002 in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into the coma and "strong" three times, while he was on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this type should be given the death penalty above all others.
To keep him alive, no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He has not stood up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the amount of suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
Revisiting Merkel’s Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US affair of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, the Green MEP, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the matter with him.
Bein almost hacked: rerun of rocker process.
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be resurrected after more than four years.
A trial of attempted killing, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds started before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safeguards.
The defendants remained silent.
They are supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and have been part of the bandidos at the time.
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of having stabbed and beaten three men in one car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have heard of the competing grouping Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, it was a multi-car persecution hunt.
According to the charges, it was a question of quadrilateral struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two accused had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
One court spokesman said at the time that it was impossible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court suspended the ruling after the review of the Public Prosecutor's office and re-negotiated it to the District Court.
One of the accused is currently in open execution for another offence.
The first point was the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
The Commissioner who was then investigating was charged as a witness.
The focus was on mobile phone calls from the accused and other people who had intercepted the police.
It is difficult that rockers almost always adhere to a law for them - and do not say so.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure.
There are 11 further negotiating days scheduled for the process.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde locks and performs with a new Bubihead for the first time.
Pamela's blonde locks have been famous since their role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a dramatic new haircut.
The former Baywatch bloom has separated itself from its long blond locks for the benefit of a platinum blonde shorthair section.
Her latest look was presented by the 46-year-old actress in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also put a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It is the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the moral change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The number of people without jobs has dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the rate at 3.1% is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, deputy head of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted in attitudes.
One reason for this, according to the Feld-Bauer, is: "We hardly have skilled workers in the craft, health care and care of the elderly".
Due to the season, employment opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been in place since September.
The winter season starts in mid-December.

At the traffic lights in continuous red: watch for waiting time.
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - driving with red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explained by the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be 'appropriate', which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before a disturbance of the traffic lights can be expected.
However, if you continue to travel in spite of red lights, you must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by this.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic lights were not defective, but rather turned into green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation, but the fine was not.
Failure to win at Bombardier after a decline in delivery numbers and orders.
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% reduction in net profit, as it was under pressure from lower orders and deliveries for third quarter aircraft and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not publish flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago was followed by only three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is scheduled to run as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his assessment from outperform to “sector perform” with a view to the stock having a limited exchange rate potential in the next one or two quarters.
“We were expected to receive weaker deliveries for aircraft as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector,” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series will catapulse the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But, so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderated at 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential for the new jet aircraft are accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the program was on schedule.
“The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference and added that while the aircraft were running, ground tests and software updates were scheduled.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, as we have done.
This is happening throughout the programme.
The second out of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, was said by the company.
However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether, twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can launch a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it over the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even though it is evidently equivalent to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or $172 million per share, respectively 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly and dropped from 4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector stood at $32.9 billion on September 30, and was thus unchanged from December 31st.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within the scope of our targets, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Revenues in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the follow-up trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 Canadian after it was announced that the Google Finance Board will change to the Board of Directors, Patrick Pichette.
On Thursday, Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10% reduction in quarterly profits.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their targets so that passengers can read e-books, watch and play videos on their equipment during critical flight phases.
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies are observing the decision that US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement, but do not have immediate plans to change their rules.
CASA also declared that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft”, was announced.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA on extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has declared that it is open to change, but it must be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a CASA review of the approval of electronic equipment, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience, now that we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesman said.
Qantas declared that, until further notice, the current rules will be retained.
"Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment should not be used at the start and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
We are, however, always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and I am sure we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect on American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases where visibility is poor, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices should be kept safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at start and landing.

Seriously injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on provincial road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but at first could say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is a fact that the 19-year-old steering officer of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old Gettorf came along with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, and the woman was so hard incumbered that the fire brigade took barely half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident was initially unsolved.
Both of them came to nearby hospitals.
The track was closed for about two hours.
British police send Assange an extradition notification.
The British police have today issued an extradition ruling to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "invitation to stand up" requesting him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not, he would be in danger of being arrested.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual offence after his powers under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition at the beginning of this month.
He feared that Stockholm would hand him over to the US on 19 June, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard asked “a 40-year-old man to meet with a police officer at a time we chose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the request for policing.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged for possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks unveiling site.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations for the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Songkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which was enthusiastic in the spring of this year, the Songkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of the Deutsches Messe von Franz Schubert at the end of the jubilee year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 at the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10:15 pm at the Church of St. Johannes Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called "Deutsche Messe" (German trade fair) with its original title, "Gesungen zur Fest des Holy Sacrifices", D 872, is a musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The exhibition will be presented in the context of the services of the Church, as the orderer Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the group of brass by the music association Frohgeist Tennn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Scientists could shed more light on the connection between a dog's cock and mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with their tail wet more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was on the left with annoying dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the University of Trient, said: “Everybody is well aware that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain half was responsible for left-wing movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail guilds of their species, the researchers supervised the animals, while these films looked at other dogs.
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyze the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, so we could steer the movement of the tail more to the left or right.
When the animals saw an otherwise out-of-print dog moved the cock to the right (seeing from the perspective of the wiping dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tailing was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog that wed), their heart rate rose and they looked unsettled.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience, in which movements they should be concerned and when not.
He said: 'If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedging with the cock in one direction is more linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of these experiences'.
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, vets and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol, declared that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: "Hunde tends to go to a robot dog when his "swimming" rides on the left and not right instead of becoming troubled," quite the opposite to the Italian study.
According to his statement, the differences could come from the fact that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"There is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
However, since their behaviour can be easily recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Tony Blair declared that he would use the opportunity to return as a British prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and has mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Middle East peacemakers.
To the question of whether he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard of London in the words: “Yes, safe, but it is unlikely that this will happen, that is, ..."
Campfire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers hide hollow body.
The fire brigade had to come out in Helmbrecht late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the county of Hof catches fire during the night.
The rescue forces are a cloaked body from the house.
In the case of a fire in Helmbrecht, rescue workers found a cloaked body in a three-family house.
As a police spokesman in Bayreuth said, whether it was a resident is still unclear.
On late Thursday evening it had been burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames already struck out of a window.
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another room were completely burnt out.
The whole ground floor has been damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building is no longer in habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Konstanz: Radler is killed by 63-year-olds.
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was travelling on Thursday evening at 10 p.m. with a women's bicycle inadmissiblely on the left foot from the station square in the direction of Marktstätte.
When a 63-year-old man from a restaurant suddenly came on the way, the police said that the cyclist could no longer brake on time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground and moved to the head a 15 centimetre long place loss.
A rescue car team brought the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.

The UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty.
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) proclaimed 12 years ago in the fight against poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium Goals, which expired in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit tonight that the time has come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These targets will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives, which are based on the success of the Millennium Goals.'
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart.
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and Klassik are currently being held at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
In so doing, Özdemir, who is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the parliamentary election of 22 September in Stuttgart, is opposed to the Grün-Roten provincial government.
On the basis of an expert study, this presses for a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the jazz and pop programme is to be moved from the Stuttgart University of Music to the University of Music in Mannheim.
Deposit houses are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class.
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned $3,000 every month (approx. 1,730 euros) as an administrative assistant and her husband also work, she does not provide sufficient monthly family income, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so great that ValueMax, where it held its exchange, became the third deposit house listed on the Singapurian Stock Exchange this week.
Pending jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Deposit houses, however, offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are quicker than banks are able to make.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for deposit houses to balance the difference in the stomping economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, called a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, a 60% increase in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, with rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further reinforced the trend to pledge personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the city state’s 200 deposit houses.
People say to themselves: 'The price of gold looks good, let us dump grandmother's gold chain and return next month'.
The largest Thai deposit house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches over the past few months.
The growth in deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, the Bendemeer branch operator and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia Value – where the company operates four houses – but also from Lee, so Yeah, CEO from outside Asia.
The company is financing this with 60% of the $66 million in Singapore this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have been thrown into the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah says that deposit houses would not only provide more favorable interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise the debt.
“Customers borrow items that they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household apprenticeship,” she explains.
The Pfandbrief bond business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Nor are not all people who use mortgages in financial difficulty.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social classes come to us.
“This includes those who borrow for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: You're not a Swallben King.
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high shape of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg as well, so the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow Kings," he took the two offensive whirl at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick’s criticism was for Mane at 3:0 against Grdyg last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a supposed play - which was certainly not, as the TV images show.
"A grossly wrong decision," Rangnick said, the referee Harkam described as "highly overstretched".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between the Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grdyg-Trainer Adi Häuer after the match.
He strongly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved in every situation in the same way as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have been in contact with his colleague after the shroud of mothers.
I do not know why.
"When I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
But in view of the success story, Rangnick agreed to praise.
"There are only two words for this: right," he said.
There is not much to blame.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let us continue to do so.
There will be little cadre change during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons for changing something.
"Other a player approaches with the desire to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that, at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026, high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England should be implemented.
Secretary of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, stated that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2 has been completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further range and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together'.
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmichael, commented: 'The announcement today is good news for Scotland'.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unmistakably" to work for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, Scotland’s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government to look at the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which provides benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and agreeing to take the next steps together.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"You are hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spun phobia, but the concern that the many stairs to the house and in the house can no longer be overcome at age, explains them.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the companion has had to know for herself what it means to move from one floor to the next.
Recently a book has been published by her on the subject of 'lücklich dwell in age - what kind of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
However, she also knows that it is one of the few people to deal with the issue of 'living in old age'.
Most of them are expelled as long as they can.
Old are always just the others', she says.
It is only when the suffering is really great that one thinks about it.
"When it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution there is not for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can become ill.
And: 'Ohn' good knowledge of the country's language can also be united in the Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist book author to consider those who want to move.
Among her models are classical care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted Renter-WG.
In the age, everyone has their tits and Mackens.
'For me, however, such a living community would be nothing', she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student hostel with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age you just need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
The author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior-living community can still work.
But this should be different from that in the classic student-WG.
And sometimes you just want to be quiet," she thinks.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital of the country.
'The majority of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people around the subject of 'bearing geothermal'.
For this reason, the elderly in particular would often accept inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends to all those who are involved in the refurbishment of their homes or homes according to their ages to give careful information first and not to hire the best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the refurbishment according to the ages.
Even in the rental apartment one or two things can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior decorator clarifies.
However, it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to the age and therefore accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although there is a stairlift within the apartment, the road also paved with stairways to the door would be much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it grayes more than in front of the spider at your home door.
NSA gets data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help.
The secret service unveiler Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to shed light on the increasingly bribery NSA affair.
According to Greens/EFA MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which ex-secretary staff would say to a German public prosecutor or to a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complex legal situation, says Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama.
Drivers seriously injured in accident.
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was travelling around 9.15 p.m. with her car on the Kempener Outdoor Ring in the direction of Grefrath.
When the road to the left on St. Töenberg Street, she saw the nearby car of the 37-year-old.
The drivers collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to hospital for treatment.
After six days of play, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League.
This is the time for the team of Ingo Ehlers to come tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope that we finally get our head off," Ehler is being somewhat optimistic.
At the same time, with the exception of Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his full cadre at his disposal.
Daverden, too, like us, is relying on speed.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
Above all, however, we need to increase the ceiling, which, at the end of the day, has left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we are far from being the favorite, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz wants to make up now in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat becomes missing.
For this, the A-Youthly Joost Windßuß, who is active with a double game right at the A-Youth Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season’s debut.
If you are not hot in such a game, you should stay at home.
Cocaine addict who warned drug-boss against police investigation must be in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to Neil Scarborough underworld size.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provides Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, praised by crimelists as "first-class" with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, which he represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed that Scarborough (32) had delivered three bags of cocaine at the House of Lawyers in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then supervised by the police in a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million in a number of house searches and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police discovered in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's rubbish bin with a purity of 60% in a black golf glove.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine, saying that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was subject to the “law of lawyers.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he is involved both at his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called on important drug-traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Anne Whyte's prosecutor said: 'A criminal justice lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law'.
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a punitive, because he has become too much involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He countered the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
In so doing, Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every wrongdoing and claimed, 'If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately.'
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to buy drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of the leading members of organised crime who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a three-fold condemnation of the possession of cocaine and judicial impairment, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other 'drugs' people have been sentenced to 153 years' total penalties for drug-related crimes.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he said that his dream job was to represent clients in the death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality.
Until now, the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to curling children who warn them against house facades.
As the homeowners realized this in time and immediately removed the egg residues, no material damage should have been caused.
Also some New Year's Elves have been lit in the city area, but no material damage has been caused here.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his passenger car was wrapped in car and his wheel blinds were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his fascinations in the immediate vicinity, and so the police did not have to carry out any further work.
A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker.
It was the 165th anniversary of the foundation's celebration to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had been happy to come.
At the club venue of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious co-existence in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the festival is always the right festivity to honour.
The special award "Change of the Year" was welcomed this time by the author Rolf Wagener.
"You haven't just written a lot for us, but you've also turned a lot for us, for that we've been very grateful," said the chairman of the choir, Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral samples by means of a series of activities went to the choral conductor Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman of the year, and.
The five-seated Notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was given by the board to the team of association economist Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again enchanted a top-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets for his regular choral samples at 7.45 p.m. in the club venue.
"New singing joyful voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
The Council is targeting track installations.
Should the train crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively restructured in order to improve road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 for this.
Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - trains collisions with other vehicles are frequently occurring throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must take part in the costs with one third, the rest share the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach’s town-building master Roland Grießinger explained to the local council the special features of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
The city is planning to build an outlet at the height of its tunnel mouth to the west of the railway.
Larger vehicles, such as those carrying long-distance timber, could also be in contact with traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Thus, Grießmeister proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the road that followed it in due course, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street proliferation: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, brought the critics' mood to the point: 'Do we need to take so much money for so few vehicles'?
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The train crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-distance transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is being transported partly over this route, because the vehicles of up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Hliegerlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a detour for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it can be predicted that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and restructured, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic impact for a longer period.
The councils agreed to have the costs of extending the road envisaged would be investigated.
Despite this, the majority agreed to the refurbishment of the railway crossing with a view to the building of the necessary support wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Stationstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns access to the highly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was easily possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not possible to rule out that the inclinations of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
Responsibility for this was also borne by the city as a road-building truck.
The conversion could therefore result in disputes over liability.
As both the timber and the bending were working in the current state of construction, it would not be acceptable to change the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of collision with a vehicle on the transition is also much lower than at the other railway crossings, because there is a direct link to the centre of the train, with a good connection to the railway.
Even trains from the main railway station should be braked at this point so far as there is no threat of collision.
The majority refused to accept the refurbishment of this railway crossing, since the city of Schiltach had to "bathe" the problem with the vehicles seated on, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work has been completed.
The Board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which already crossroads agreements with the railway have been concluded.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era.
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European energy projects, declared the Chairman of Gazprom.
“The event today is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun,” said Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity in Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, provides for increased risk in conventional routes, as is publicly heard.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been “indefinitely.”
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project is operational in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other neighbouring countries are to begin on the scheduled route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls.
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be any breakthroughs like this at Vienna-Schwechat airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker transmission is thus eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of breakthroughs for individual persons.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already waiving the noisy calls.
With the removal of these throughputs - on average about 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers sound in one day - it is intended to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight or departure times are somewhat underestimated here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker.
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to talk directly.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines Stand-up Institute, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"The majority of these headliners began with Carolines and then became ever more successful until they were too well known to appear in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there will be performances by Roger Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for the Army veteranes at Madison Square Garden.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the Comedians attending the festival this year have become known by more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable TV (the ironic-swept fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation" even though it is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Belldy focused on racial issues) are products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor attractions of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy-DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he is here he sometimes walk through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
At the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwald Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and on Sunday, 24 and 25 August, to a colourful children's and family celebration with numerous activities and events during the summer vacation programme.
The press release states that "big and small can learn different old crafts on both days".
Whether making soap, turning candles, filtration or making ropes, for every age the right thing is there.
Regional craftsmen are at your disposal from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as drawer races or slit races, promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, each at 12 and 2 p.m.
On an off-road tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lied.
In addition, visitors have a special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a guided tour with Black Forest Frafts.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which will drive their shack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner’s work is cosy and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairytales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the Gutach children’s dance group performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, many craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the proximity, the spider, the weavator and the baker are able to look over the shoulder in their traditional work from 11 to 5 pm.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday programme.
Networking of universities and companies
On his visit to the Breisgau High Black Forest county, President Guido Wolf also explained where tomorrow's workforce came from in Titisee-Neustadt.
He studied this important issue in the High Black Forest funding centre, together with the Executive School Leaders of the Professional Schools and the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairmen of the Parental Advisory Committee.
"Education is an important location factor," Claudia Standle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochblackwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the city of Forestry.
He also praised the family friendliness of the county.
"It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also at the period of care for family members due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more workers took care of and caring for their loved ones.
"Other support for employers can result in the resulting burden on employees ending the working relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already experienced the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often stays in the regional economy, which helps to strengthen the region," the President of the country declared himself convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
"Don't hesitate and make sure that public transport is improved," he said to the local politicians present.
Australian appeals against imprisonment in Thailand.
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the ruling and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after having told the Thai police that a local taxi driver stuck her in the morning tenth.
Later, however, the pictures of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until they realized that they had thought up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuket instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has addressed the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help with his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extrem concerned” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia.
"We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is free on a deposit of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports, she has meanwhile been on holiday in the Krabi holiday resort in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local attorney in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel trader Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may try to improve its wounded tourist image, and it is therefore an acquittal.
Painting the fence on the Bechtle base.
A group of the "Schweizer Mese" citizens' initiative has embellished the Bauzaun on the Bechtle-base at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, as stated in a press release.
The planned coverage of the crumbling house in the rear part of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons, because the site is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the plot, had agreed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message 'We are for' had been put in place.
However, this did not disturb the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative much in their actions.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against construction ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail.
In discussions with many passers-by in front of the building site, it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will be better for many, even though not a few have the same questions as the BI project.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it is said by the BI.
As has been said, the Mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May said at the Council meeting that he feared the spa being put off if the public were to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the public decision.
Some people seem almost frightened, and others see it as a "plumpen attempt to blackmail" on the population, as stated in the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group.
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gite-gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, declared the global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday, while serious clashes in the north of the country are being held near one of the sites that are likely to be toxic to those.
On Thursday, too, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of the meeting
1 November, set by the Hague-based organisation Damascus to destroy or make "inoperable" chemical weapons facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling of chemical weapons.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin to destroy the weapons and stocks that exist.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senf gas and the nerve gas coffin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, by experts saying that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as the United Kingdom-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated.
On Thursday, the group of activists who are persecuting the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria declared that 120.296 people have died.
Of these, 6,1.067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad’s army that 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This figure has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of which have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but did not mention details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a deadly civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is 'unconvinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction'.
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are planned at the moment'.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, as the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites had been abandoned, according to the Syrian statement, and the chemical weapons program’s existing objects had been moved to other aforementioned facilities, which were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a commentary published by the OW.
For three years now, the main Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, belonging to many members of the Alawites, a secession of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a massive explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
RBS suspends two Forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign-exchange department, two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide regulatory investigation of the alleged manipulations of the currency market is rapidly underway.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, with 5.3 billiards changing U.S. dollars a day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation resulting from the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the RBS indicated that the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader were forwarded to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is due to have been left on JPMorgan from his current position as European head of the forex commercial trade.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was left on holiday this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been accused of any misconduct.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, saying people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the Forex market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority, Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers have agreed on currency transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks get instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of maladministration.
The news of these investigations has put traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility has limited the chances of speculation.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market, but leading traders believe that it is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks would lead to “influencing prices with very low ticket prices.”
The news came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced that it announced this week to a retailer of its London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of just under $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter has been contained,” said Credit Suisse.
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a hint.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone-hacking, surveillance, and confrontation" to try to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the then interior minister, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractional special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack and track Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"As the Public Prosecutor's view, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is no one who faces the home of people and hopes to catch it up with fresh action," but one who likes to see her a story.
He said that NotW uses three methods to research stories investigative: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
Do he know about the phone-hacking?
He denies this, but we say, 'and if he knew of it'.
Rumours about a Clarke affair were first picked up by the feature editing of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: 'Do not waste your time, it is together with Charles'.
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the search was running, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup overseen the surveillance of Pawlby’s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett confronted a married woman for an affair, when he himself was licensed to the co-indict Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks struggle to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone-hacking.
Early puberty: to grow faster.
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries, as studies show.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty.
The trend for early puberty is less pronounced among boys.
Former CNN correspondent, Pat Etheridge, is a journalist specialised in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and moray hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American standard girls.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is rapidly entering,” said Kaplowitz.
Apparently adverts to development, such as growing breasts, shame and achselhairs, as well as body odor, appear in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (acting the first bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two or three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "French puberty in girls: the essential counselor to deal with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is “early ripe” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is quicker, tests could be displayed by an endicoronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are methods of treatment for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to growth inhibitment, and thus a small amount of body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their co-workers.”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with ten.
Although there were initial signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not prepared emotionally.
She was frightened and excited by the school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Young people come to puberty like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most persuasive premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and entry to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to the climate to genes.
Another mystery: even though young people are growing face and shame hair earlier, the trend for a fuller past puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamehair is common even for babies and infants.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrineologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Illmensee: The second race of mountain bikes enthuses participants.
In magnificent weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round trip over the chains of hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel advises the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, in particular on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, there were also numerous amateur bikers who once wanted to practice their hobby in competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation for good places in the German Championships.
The two were expected to stand off from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time advance to the goal and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to be placed on second place again.
The ladies were Theresa Duelli from Team Albtraum, who managed it at the top of the winning streak.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen came to the place two and three.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of sportsmen was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years at the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute topathletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to distance themselves from the top regional riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a half-bike professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was twice the world champion in the 12-hour race.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
In addition, Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls his own two German master titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was an eye catching final in the finish line in front of the three-seen-Halle.
Pangerl is the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the target as a third of the overall rating.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race in the women's rating.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binlieuen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized running of the event.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, as official sources say.
Israeli hunting planes would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed by a senior government official vis-à-vis Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Before the quadriderby against Schalke, BVB trailers who had travelled along had provided light missiles for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced tough consequences.
The ultras reacted with a silence before the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart - first of all.
It was an unusual, almost eerie acoustic, that offered the viewer until just before the launch of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-president Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of them were the guest fans with their vocals.
The South Stand, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - fans of BVB stand, was initially exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint initiation, remained unfilled.
And at the very front of the gallery, a big flag with the title "Section of stadium ban" was blowing lonely.
Just as the first BVB player to enter the place, as always, as a foekeeper of Roman Weidenfeller, he branded short-term jubilee.
When his teammates followed, there were vocals and worrisome shawls – but far from everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand.
Also, that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbywin, victory over Arsenal, extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a festive atmosphere.
Only five minutes before the raft begins its podium - and the tension, which until then almost with hands, spreads out in a loud scream, as thick as usual, the atmosphere at the ranks of the stadium ripens.
Finally, as always, the South Stand was the turn - and at last it was the loudest place in the stadium again as usual.
And at the latest when the shouting call "Derby Winner stands up" came with an inspiring from the South Stand, everything was again as always.
The silence before it was probably a response to what has happened over the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at Schalke 04 FC, some of the BVB supporters had fired light missiles into the crowd and onto the square, hitting Roman Weidenfeller almost to the goalkeepers.
The game was belatedly kicked off due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the ultras of Dortmund in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the ultras from choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have banned this," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have shown different ways of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Mr Watzke says, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is becoming incisive," insured Watzke .
We can look forward to hearing what the reactions in the South Stand will be.
What happens on the way with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail implemented in the design of the Internet service in a way similar to that of conventional mail?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, no attention has been paid to creating a solid foundation for an hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the hosts of the two connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if it has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run over many other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his provider.
Will conventional e-mails be read through the network?
Most mails are read multiple times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks if the mail carries a harmful program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether this is annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google will be able to provide appropriate links to holiday offers.
Read also unknown people with the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorised people will read a mail is very low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mail.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying-outs.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively for read-in.
It is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication with a high technical effort, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used postboxes, Yahoo and Google, according to a survey by Convios Consulting in August 2013, play only a minor role.
While the stakes of Yahoo-mail had fallen last, GMail could increase significantly from Google.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of parishes: the Evangelical Church of Hanover expects that the number of their currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in talks with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien refers this to the process of de-christization: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
In doing so, the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where I think it is important.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a sea-care provider.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly, more is being paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is a response to the young people of today, who are concerned not only with careers, but with meaningful work.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology study begin their Vikariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
A hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes.
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual crimes related to children before charges were made against the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse in 2011.
But, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA declared that “the organisation never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children.”
Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee had been charged for child pornography offences, and another one where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of the abuse in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer who assisted the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that “the YMCA had external checks, in which the YMCA was recognized as the front line in child safety.”
Rather, evidence from the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed "from me down" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report child security.
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare denied that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of children’s safety.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as babysitting, had them sit on his lap, one said that he loved it, and had children play with his mobile phone.
He was a member of the Royal Society for Children's Relief and Works .
The manager explained that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superiors.
Instead, as he said, their friendship with Lord compromised their judgment, which is why they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord incident” was “not agreed to report” and met by employees.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations were made was taken by the CEO of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent the contamination of the evidence, which was 'overzealous' and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there have been “remarkable problems” in recruitment, review, initiation, training, and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne at around 120 metres in length.
If you are visiting Cologne, you won't miss the Cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky around 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers imagine that there is also a lot to be discovered under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne Unterwelt.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground parking lot", says Schulze.
In the 1970's, the town's fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and that is why the remains of the old city wall only remained, which wasn't too big.
For this reason, most of the users of the Park House have passed the remains of the Romans today and only leave their car.
However, if you look more closely, you will find an archeological site separated by metal bars in the park deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins from hand-made-sized stones.
"The remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.," Schulz said.
Before it goes back to the day, Schulze gives the participants at the upper park level a glimpse into a dark, 15-meter deep chess.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
Next station of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants get down to the depths.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is what a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinalium", which means in good German as "City of Roman Law and City of Agrippiners, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former palace of the lords, the center of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hall there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
"You can walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like," Schulze bows up the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16-meter deep, walk-in chess.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its baths deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighteenth century, different water levels can be traced by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction works are due to begin shortly.
However, a few years will go by before completion.
Land Rover Rally Series announced.
The interior features racing seats and six-point gifts as well as an intercom system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for bowler workgroups and logistic support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, says: "The rally customers who come to bowlers have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventures, as well as for an accessible way to world class events.
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, and to prepare newcomers for the rallies and the reality.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Tour – this will be an entertaining championship.
There is also a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice.
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border guarded with barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal drew attention to the possible economic benefits that would bring about greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland is not currently a member of the Schengen area, continuing non-respect for Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So there is no story.
And one who has already come in such a way that she already likes a fossil: for the first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls"-Ente at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or who want to throw the euro out of the single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party alternative for Germany – founded only this year – won almost five million votes in the September general election, effectively expelling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket that the national economy is forced into by maintaining the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that as it did.
Without the possibility of depreciating the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much as the United States for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage fixing does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being squeezed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the EU’s former cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris more than a gateway to political legitimacy and has put Europe on its own economic policy, with which the French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive post-election, thus placing the ruling socialists on the top three.
The Front National is now France’s most popular party, with 24% of voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division on the right would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What is Le Pen doing with its newly won popularity among the working-class white Frenchman?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the 'Europe of (sovereign) nations' that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of humiliating itself with the United States.
But Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (last consequence) Small-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to say to Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where.
I suspect that, if we keep our own currency, Scotland could go well in a looser European group.
Cooperation with other countries that think the same way is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same as Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland, remarkably, is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and planned) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister and Assad followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt now for independence only to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft (but no mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the image of films, but not using the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FA) on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the air crew and the rules on the maintenance of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"When, according to the condition of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a declaration.
At present, passengers will have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors are closed.
They may not be re-started until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must switch them off again and must not restart them before the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start, landing and rolling stock, the FAA declared.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to higher altitudes for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional cabin crew, welcomed the changes.
"When the new regulation has been implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like caretakers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet access to surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages, or downloading data below three kilometres remain prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there is still no "Words With Friends", the online game similar to Scrabble, which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public because he refused to shut off the plane.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts on national traffic issues on CBS News, that mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruptions to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters,” says Rosenker.
Last month, an industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to study this issue, recommended that the government allow for a broader use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease use restrictions.
Critics such as Missouri's democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid grounds for safety for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers, after reports of passenger-controlled navigation and communications equipment disruptions by UKW radios, which were then the latest technology trends.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to make electronic interference irrelevant to them.
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi for passengers for a number of years now when the flight is reached.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Readers, for example, only give out minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing restrictions on passengers' use of equipment.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-Reader and took a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to detect any problems.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that the equipment was defective, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members have said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who would suggest that aircraft systems are disrupted by the equipment, most of which are very old.
The Committee, however, recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to arrange the shutdown of the equipment by passengers in low-visibility situations.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers, who today were well equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham.
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pig pulls, but turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel it comes into the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he is allowed to use the micro.
Jumbo for the reinforcement of quick snack in the forest hat.
"Here, I am working on a huge amount of things," the TV-makers, black-forest ham as a mass product are amazed.
16,000 culls per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important in quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the pulp value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"There I'm eager to see if your Roberto Blanco scores what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it is worth watching.
The spectator sees that the culling of the culls continues to be hand-crafted.
For: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bone on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke-fire remind Jumbo of a "U-Boot".
The trick: tanning branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in smoke.
After all, 20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo", he announces the test feeding.
"They's really delicious," said the conclusion of the TV-star.
This will enable all parties to live with.
Joyful City: Fast actions are the key to the success of host.
With a narrow cadre, Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school tournament hall in Reutlingen.
The elders stood on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became clear that she couldn't fully compete with the rapid actions of the joy cityrs.
The Gönninger's hard and placed suits were extremely hard.
Again, they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly through the center of the network and were not there for block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cityrs in all respects.
In view of this oppressive and playful performance, the third sentence was then won somewhat lax and lustless to the 3:0 end stand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly won in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent in the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Rballr, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in front of the Murgtalhalle.
They delivered a hard-won two-hour tie.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in the ball taking; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes the incapacity prevented the eye from seeing possible points.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto was always right for the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible.
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning", mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring forward ideas.
He made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the local council".
The floods that Gechingen met on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been an incisive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The basis for the planning of the protection against a flood which is expected every 100 years according to the German weather service is statistically.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
This is called "HQ 100aClima" in professional circles.
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to count on regional subsidies amounting to around 70%.
However, he pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the Municipal Council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the valley of the headquarters.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to bring their concerns to bear.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, the expert planner of the commissioned Engineering Office Wald and Corbe from Bergesheim, who presented the concept, stressed the need for the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
There was an inconvenience among old residents who, even with normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from overloading of the channel network.
The problem is well known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two or three years of rain events could be tolerated.
To dimensionalize the sewage channels more would consume millions.
The newly designed opbeat shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make its name a program.
Déjà Vu, according to the Lexicon, is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the University of Applied Sciences Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu-fe.
After all, the Café with its beautiful name has exactly that: to make a real stay not only mentally, but to make it vividly recurring.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the interior at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right at the start.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool, cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team, together with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the head, spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktails.
You can also enjoy delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already named themselves as astronomers before the opening of the charming Café am Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly Café lovers hope to have more audiences.
Not least by the university.
"When we do not have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two here want to address young students as much as seniors and all age classes in between.
Speaking of Café lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoy the fragrant hot tan in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino trinker.
"It's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were also available in the bright cafe.
Better to say one thing.
Because the Port Festival was more likely to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
The two 33-year-olds found "Schön, Success and Fun".
But it is not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner isn't a great fan of event evenings: "You can't make it all right".
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event.
For this reason, events will be rather the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu.
Anke Gellert-Helpenstein.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over the width of seats in the face of large orders.
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of tourist seats on long-haul flights, which is the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seating range offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines are making the most effort, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency estimates of Airbus and the latest Boeing SAS Co aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a seating range of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The conflict comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
How the rear part of the aircraft is shaped – particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the specified economic results to deliver the new Mini-Jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" would be 406 people in tourist-class seats that are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus announces that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide tourist-class seats, with nine per row.
Air giants often share information about technical details by means of advertisements in the press.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to complete the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war, with donors showing an image of three people sitting in a restaurant, smuggled together with the title: 'Can you accept that?'
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props,” says Airbus’ CEO John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the average male American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the male average American is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950’s, when the average body volume of the newly baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus on the number of seats and says that it is not at the manufacturers' discretion to decide how airlines will balance air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to studies, the experience on the aircraft is more than the width of the seat.
“It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to do in order to succeed,” explains Boeing’s air cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about greater elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is becoming increasingly a subject that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated amount of at least USD 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the 777X, with its ten seats per row, being compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in costs per unit is still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore pushes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full ten-seater cabins per row, with 777s in existence, indicated that many passengers opted for a tighter arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
“Atten inch seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin equipment, founder and editor of Girway Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can select.
The world-renowned jet sales even carry band measure to measure the equipment in the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a 10-seater A350, but, according to its own statement, has not sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and has offered wide-range seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate, but could divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
Veganism, according to the Lexicon, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs in a very significant way from this one.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat Sahnetorte, ice or a strong Edamer, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renouncement of meat and fish, the vegan leaves the vegan from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
One might wonder what remains, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bred-ups are very popular," says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop at the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he has (almost) everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He recognized that it is also possible to deal with other everyday issues without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor explains the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumer behavior.
Instead of burgers, whirlers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products, and enthusiasm increased.
"It is a double bonus," Proctor says today, "In fact, vegan does not represent a renunciation, not a ascetics, but rather an enrichment".
It is precisely these conditions that led to the failure of some of the well-intentioned attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very important factor, which quickly gives up many, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And applies: "Determined tastes are not to be fixed on the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
Proctor brings, for example, aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegans.
He is looking for a balanced, varied diet, which is why it should be savoured with a soft taste.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not just to reduce animal food," Proctor said.
He has not suffered any damage to health, to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
As far as I am concerned, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take up a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin level.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I'll check myself often," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cold rest, the vitamin B12 portion is high," finds Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go for food procurement.
After all, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the ground.
I buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what we know about "usual" finished products.
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than was generally thought.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not in part better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more bakery powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cakes Proctor could also cause his ashes to amaze.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This is dynamic when you work together, it is a new priority.
"The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, he was already sceptical.
Do you not wake up my meal any more?
"When I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - when it comes to issues such as this one has to act as vegans with sensitivity.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to put up an enclave.
And, more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan-unconscious as you might have imagined - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as it was generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fommes are available everywhere!
"Many döner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, it dispenses with pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, everything is a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adjust to this.
"When I began to feed myself in vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, draw attention to it".
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the combüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogellose.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan meal on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Special dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"When you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the most of it impossible from the start," Proctor says.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as colored encoders, following ethics on so many hurdles and traps seems to leave the courage quickly.
It is not only for this reason that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animalic ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used for food and also cleaning.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to, "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stay standing or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger that strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not entirely manage to dismiss his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
Despite defeat, Bavaria’s basketball team is optimistic.
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich's basketball teams.
"Never can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe of the last two years," said Bavaria-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) titled Pirkos on Thursday evening.
We sent the message: basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European premier class, Munich sold itself very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the art of transforming a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus once again gave the game a turning point.
"We've been incredibly fighting against the twice Euroleague champion, but then made some frivolous mistakes," said Bavaria-professor Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful shooters of Munich, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More attempts are needed before human testing, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is so much stronger than these approaches.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In attempts, vaccinated mice administered by nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “out time,” the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine has reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contain antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future human vaccine, if it is safe, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know then: when they start smoking again, they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to abandon their habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.

Egypt Spoils first freely elected presidents.
Mohamed Morsi dismisses the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn as the country’s first freely elected president, following the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and Egypt’s fifth leader since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He surrendered the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, with his seat at the Nile, who was found to be an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability,” said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the US and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been sharply prohibited since its establishment.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential punk from Mubarak’s time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the autokonvoi could cross the suburbs to the south.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he wanted to move not only as a candidate for Islamists, but against the year of rebellion that the aspirations.
“Egypts today is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state,” declared the Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-panned chamber in which he dismissed.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he heard in custody.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university’s largest hearing room with voice listeners of “The Army and the people are a single hand.”
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970’s.
Morsi dismissed a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday, the birthplace of the insurgency that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential power from the head of office.
However, with the removal of the official oath before the court and not before Parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, pointing out that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir.
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s story is almost twice as long at the men’s choir in Cäcilia as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colors of his men's club.
Even after 60 years of singing with the choir, which is probably more than loved, still gives him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, as the choir has also signed a church choir.
His vocal colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association and a serious tinteller.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual stages: with the MGV Betra, the Songkranz Salzstetten, the singers' department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringers had a colourful mixture of different style.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, her brother".
To honour their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jäger Werbe" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" from Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The Songkranz Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulschor" - ensured the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folks "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages.
The singer section of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to the home with "What is the Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" where the "Future Music Association" was the final stage.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led a casperl theatre and read out a few stories that the children had a lot of time.
Frontier Airlines charges hand baggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers who wish to store their hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that if the charge is paid in advance, it will be charged USD 25 and USD 100 for travellers who paid at the airport.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the charge of $100 targets to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second piece of checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore packed as much as possible into their hand baggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a piece of luggage free of charge at the Frontier gate, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that Frontier's website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the charge before they came to the landing.
Frontier's new hand baggage charge will not enter into force until the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often vaccinate over baggage allowances and other charges, but airlines are happy to make use of them.
They argue that transporting luggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them have left the fingers of charges for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost carrier, followed.
The only other airline with such a charge was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the Spirit hand baggage fee is USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held leadership at Midwest Airlines, has recently flowed with spirit and was curious what would happen to him at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual hand baggage charge.
“The boarding process was one of the most smoothest I have seen in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see teeth knobs and handy discussions at the landing stage.
"The plane was full," he said, 'and boarding was running as molten'.
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and that coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly sought money for soft drinks, but reversed it seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontier's step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to allocate only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the route.
For this reason, customers only receive 250 miles from a flight booked with Frontier by a third party provider.
Passengers can also reserve seats only for direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues declined by 9 percent, and flight capacity declined by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the company's sales.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, which was within walking distance of the heart of the city, Manhattan.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening lights.
By the time shift the students were on their legs almost 24 hours, but according to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached on the second day by ferry and could be reached on foot.
Subsequently, the financial center was about Wall Street as the memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students of the 373 m high viewing platform of the Empire State Building could gain an overview of the fascinating city while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, the hectic pace of New York’s streets through the Rockefeller Center went to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short break in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the everyday life of the Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way past Germany as a real estate location.
The economic frameworks are right, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As Germany's commercial properties are looking for, look at the transaction volume, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the prior-year period.
In Britain, the plus was only 6%, and in France it was 19%.
"Immobile investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder.
The parents of the Teenager, whose body was found in a coiled ring mat in the gymnastics of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, declared the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an up-to-date mat, which stood behind the grandstand in the Schoolturnhalle.
The Sheriff’s lowndes County investigation officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that the 17-year-old’s family was in doubt.
"You are convinced that their son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it violates all logics against the laws of physics as well as common sense,” says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the corpse bag," he commented.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death, as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of “position-based suffocation.”
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in a different cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added, if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil law investigation to Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff Authority was not ready to comment immediately on Thursday's request.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said that they hoped that the video recordings had indications of how he died.

John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, states that US espionage “has gone too far unreasonably.”
John Kerry, with an unexpected acknowledgement, suggested a weakening of the US’s defense stance on its surveillance programs by saying that spying was “unreasonably too far” in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for “autopilot” when the explosive revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA’s spying activities became public.
The leaked information has brought the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a video-related speech at the London Open Government Conference, Kerry said, “The President and I, and others in the government, have learnt of some things that were almost done by autopilot, simply because the Cold War was still difficult to do so.
Afterwards, he became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been misused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far unduly'.
The President is determined to make things clearer and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a power of the good and that many lives had been saved by their surveillance operations.
He added: 'We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow up themselves'.
There is a radical extremism in the world obsessed with killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
What, then, would be if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learnt from such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage, and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts on Thursday, as the chairman of the Senate says.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to cease participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of frustration over the National Security Agency's monitoring.
“It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time, and is acting as Chairman of the Washington Senate for Foreign Affairs.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger through the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although this week the head of the intelligence service said that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the United States' metadata.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden’s published documents, according to which the NSA has overseen Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was common practice on both sides.
In all this tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congress to travel this year, hoping that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some 'earthly words'.
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs that they themselves have been using for years.
“When we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,” says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is embarking on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
Children’s Dreams become Real
The kindergartens and day nursery schools in the Zollernalbkreis will receive post in these days.
The Schwarzwald Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beautification requirements.
Do the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and nursery crèches from the entire customs circle can be involved in the action.
If you have a wish for building or beautification for your establishment, you can apply for this with the Black Forest Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwald Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction material value of a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many hard-working pawns.
What is the action day and the helper?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave.
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, made the claim that he wanted to put questions off the table as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether or not to cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not to leave,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission Palmer officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine-Coast-session with 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process to make it happen more quickly.
Tony Abbott’s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you are marching in, entering data into a computer, immediately choose and then have the result at 6:30 a.m. in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Is it used because you can then wipe out the results if you don't like them?
Today it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his politics belong to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about serving the public.
“We are not seeking a reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions.
Far planets, waves of gravity or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are at least some of them.
The selection is difficult: should you search for gravitational waves?
Or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, looking for earth-like planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that are being asked by the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such 'L missions' is approximately EUR 1 billion each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas have been discussed, five of them have now come to a close.
A number of committees assess the proposals and the researchers are failing.
A final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared spacer could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this issue, the "Cheops" space telescope will be launched in 2017, which will examine more closely the 500 planetary systems already known in our vicinity.
The opportunities are limited, however, and Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets, and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be the indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the creation of life.
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role in the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation that it emits to the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved an M-class mission (the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is supposed to start in 2017 and watch the sun's surface and activity closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa envisages the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are some deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory that can unite all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come about and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to the material we know, the stars, planets, and living beings as we do, there is dark matter, the gravity of which holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the world.
Until now, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of the original case, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With 'Euclid', the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is supposed to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts "E-Lisa", the best chances of approval as L-mission has a sophisticated concept for detecting gravity waves.
This means changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, he could also prove the waves of gravity that were created at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is supposed to study black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism".
Proposals for the retrieval of Mars, exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics have already been abandoned.
CDC publish allergic guidelines for schools.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for the handling of food allergies to children at schools.
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued, as the number of children requiring school is increasing with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin on stock – the epiPen brand’s car injection is most widely used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
National legislators have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressed on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it” or “My tongue is being bullied”.
The fire brigade called for the rescue of a hut that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel rubbish had gone away after a minor traffic accident.
Three days later, it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its defiant location.
The fire fighters leaned on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade was able to bring a bit of security that was fixed on a 15-metre high edge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch, Ruby, had died after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They had desperately sought for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped to the quarry after a small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter high paragraph in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said, “It was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like stiffly frozen.
But now it is doing well.
She then served a few cakes for dogs.
It was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the specialist of the technical rescue team, said: 'Ruby had a great luck'.
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian's attention, but it did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'Being at the rescue was frightening'.
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor.
The vet told us that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire-fighters have done a great deal.
What they did was really courageous.
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: 'We were afraid that it would fall down, but it remained up'.
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe where it was.
U.S. border: "super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling.
At the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a 'super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities announced, the more than 500-metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks, and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana were seized and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are foolish if they think they could dig through the radar," said the US district's Southern Californian, Laura Duffy, general prosecutor, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy told the drug gangs: 'If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and took about a year to build it.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building which is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder 20 meters deep leads to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 m height and 90 centimetres width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, and the press conference in San Diego continued.
However, this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities, not through tunnels.
This is shown by the "dis despair" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, Bill Sherman said of the drug scandal DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything to get into the US.
No details were given about the prisoners, at least one was Mexican.
They are expected to receive prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama’s Reversal in Health Policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday retireed on his often repeated, clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it'.
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of dismissal, the Republicans have over the last few days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativeed his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less than predicted.
“They come up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as no surprise that the 5% of the population who have taken out insurance would have to look for a different rate, because their contract does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserabel" since October.
“I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement by an angry Sebelius as a behind-the-becoming adviser at yesterday’s meeting in the House of Representatives was accepted after a dispute with Republican Missouri MEP Billy Long from Missouri, who was supposed to be required to attend.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the “Affordable Care Act” did not voluntarily renounce government-sponsored insurance to sell a HealthCare fare for millions.
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indefinitely".
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with undefined genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undefined" on the certificate of birth.
The aim of the law is to remove the pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding sexual allocation operations in newborns and to combat discrimination against inter-sexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said, 'I am neither man nor woman'.
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and scared.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year is not born as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that comes under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a term of collection for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands or homicides.
Valais Simpson may have been inter-external.
The understanding of gender identity is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US are advised to use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, rather than waiting for a child’s psychological and physical development.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialises in the problem of gender identity, said that the new German law “sounds for a good thing.”
Inter-sexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it is happening.
It is like the secret that people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission of 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-based, but rather gender-based, which is neither male nor male.
These characteristics were manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by inter-sexual and transgender people in their professional lives and the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or third gender on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “dealless” person after a court had granted the life-long retention of an “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German cards will have a third assignment in the future, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
Gender issues are still controversial in neighboring France, such as a news story about France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “gender theory” should be removed from schoolbooks.
The American website Catholic Online has also voted against the German law, on the grounds that 'if the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are distorting two more pillars of civilisation'.
The mother of a newborn from Maryland said to Baby Zone that they would be better off if babies were given a gender at birth.
"The parent's existence is already stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex parts were called Hermaphrodite, according to the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then reconstructed.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, as it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels with the gender they have assigned.
“The middle of the 20th century was called a “psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with undefined genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was formal.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives – as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person was male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/Joan" in 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a disguised circumcision, to completely castrated the child and also to remove his trods and then to raise him up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But in the 1990’s, with the Internet’s entry, survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public, who are “not happy with the result.”
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfaction life” as a man.
So his external organ and the trods were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But, since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to the male identity, received testosteron injections and was able to remove his breasts.
It has become infertile due to the operation.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law can “encourage to stamp and stigmatize.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a "not defined" to the child," she explained.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about assigning at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are adult, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg breast-radiologin, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law "entitles" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance.
Due to the recipe defect of the target cells for testosteron, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie 29 is married and works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychologist.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to rush to make decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And we do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be undone.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are exaggerating because they think they are not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Excellently mastered the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", is cut to Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier, the art of acting.
No one can deceive the old Santiago man when it comes to fishing.
So the two simply complement each other tremendously.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fishing boy Manolo talks.
When Santiago sits tired of life bowing on the chair, that is real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage for a long time as solo performer.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention so that his monologists are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he illuminates the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Liebe, who with her songs and her wonderful voice possessed the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark – with the help of Quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent features of marine animals and created a shining shining shining shining shin.
The idea came after reading a research work on Quallen and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire.
Chris explains that the icing ice reacts to the warmth in the mouth and denies – so the more you lean, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the Ice Cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: 'The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds'.
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal for us to launch it to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced, because the quality fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: 'I would like to develop an invisible ice cream'.
This is in itself impossible due to the break-up of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to make it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quality artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum of Dialogue.
The next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, in the Neues Museum of the Schloss is about "Zur Hölle mit der Hölle - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical parishes of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance Culture Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much over the past centuries and had placed on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which still characterize our ideas," certain contemporary prophetic teachings of the hope of accomplishment would be more likely to emerge from the hope of perfection.
"The greater hope has been expelled by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has 'provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamations'.
Johanna Rahner continues to say: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is the question of that longing, 'which dreams that in the end everything will be good'.
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated in 1997 from Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for fundamentals and ecology followed in 2003 at the Westphalia Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner holds a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Fair gives answers to wedding questions.
"Memocracy is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard said.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony succeeds now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important suppliers around a wedding were represented.
One trend: the retro look has been reinstated.
This begins, for example, with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front are closed the dresses with embroidery, often with a veil, but at the back they go down and often end up in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashion house Clothmüller, the spirits differ.
For gentlemen, the suit dominates with waist and plastron, but also cream-coloured or brown combinations can be chosen.
It is important to choose the place, was explained.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to go ahead with the coach, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Cheels are also popular for young people's adoptions", he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "After Wedding Photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued Nortel patents.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, tightened on Thursday an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against cellular phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by the Insolvency Auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patents had bought for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the US court.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents deal with technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and lastly offered $4.4 billion.
After being overwhelmed by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola acquired a $12.5 billion Mobility, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library.
"Although Google has failed with his attempt to acquire the right to appeal patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the letter of complaint.
Rockstar asks for a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the accusation.
Frankfurt parking charges are expected to increase significantly.
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become much more expensive.
This morning, the city’s magic representative is discussing a presentation by Transport deputy Stefan Majer (Green).
This means that parking charges will be increased by 50%.
For this, however, it is not to raise prices, but to reduce the time interval of parking timers and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt's Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The parking just in front of the shop was "a good advantage for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "a very appropriate and, in fact, long overdue".
Public transport will also become more expensive.
Oil prices continue to be up to USD 96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
In December, the reference commodity for supplies fell by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe at the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8% fall in prices in October.
The large amount of crude oil in the past few weeks has been a burden on prices.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter in two decades.
Oil from Brent variety, a reference value for international crude, also used by US refineries, fell to the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $10.58 per barrel.
The Landscape Society Do not Think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
The only thing is that in the hoses of the people on the front-passenger seat and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or two cocktails or sparkling wines may be responsible for this!
What's more, than going to the next drive in order to get a little bit more fun?
I admit that I am happy to attend when it is late at night or early in the morning to the fast-food-Holen.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nix like from home and into bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers are striking.
Because what is missing is that you always throw your fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially at weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are the people too tired to take the bags home with respect to the next garbage bin?
It is not just the case that the paperware migrates the landscape.
Bags have already hidden transport facilities such as guide-planks and have caused accidents.
However, what does the term "disposal society" mean, it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are travelling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back bench can look like after spent nights: clothing, bottles and other garbage are catching up.
There would be a few bags more or less still nix - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to migrate to the remains of other people's food.
I can see that the day is coming when the towns and villages will have to get rid of them - and the fast-food chains have to ask for deposits for their bags.
Overview of milk and egg alternatives.
Vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pampered tofu with vegetable cream is, for example, a substitute for Quark.
The Vegetarian League is named for World Vegan Day on November 1.
The German Vegetarian Association proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure herbal margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt let replace with soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, almond or rice milk can be used.
Acceptable cream replaces traditional cream.
There are also vegetable alternatives for eggs.
For example, half a crushed ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
It is also suitable for 50 grams of apple or a spoon grounded linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water.
Equipped instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
However, 50 grams of soya yoghurt or Seidentofu can also fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany are now vegan, i.e. purely vegetable.
A Blackbox in the car?
American street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the failing highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal state planning offices to review the obsolete system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups, arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax deductions.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress is unable to agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's not something we'll use," said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mileage on all California's drivers in the state from 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from taxes that US Americans pay on the Zap Pile, is bankrupt.
But in America there is no longer as much to thank as it was in the past.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high fuel prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most useful long-term alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and polluting emissions.
California’s planners are relying on the system for developing policies to achieve the federal state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change targets.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having riders pay on a long-distance route.
“This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,” says Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Ministers, who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mile-based accounting.
Last year, the US Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural Members representing people who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently acquiring 5,000 riders for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges to the state rather than the fuel tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it with heavy goods vehicles to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Beware of Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
People did not want it.
When the test started, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can capture the kilometres that have been driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also reassure the public.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially act to help states tax car drivers.
Rather, it was their aim to gain foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the mileage that they had travelled.
But the devices they test are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“The people are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment and instead pay a flat rate on the basis of the miles averaged by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax equipment to pay for parking fees, to pay insurance only for kilometres driven, and to collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid congestion.
"The added value of the benefits that the system offers would motivate drivers to participate," stated in a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation, if an aspirin is enough,” explains Randy Rentschler, the head of Commission legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC.
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf in spite of the cold weather and the rain did not spoil the importance of the city and the football club.
I think that everyone wanted a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Petrus did not want to be part of it.
So all those who came without umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the festive act, as did many speakers.
Nass was therefore also the chairman of the FC, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who has been very committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the companies involved and the members of the association who took part.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul wheategger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sculpted pensioners laid 400 m2 of pavements for the new paths.
The honourable Member, Karl Rombach, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Other greetings were addressed to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the Southbad Football Federation, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn moved to the original lawns square in such a way that he could not be played.
Fifteen years ago, the first thoughts were on how to solve the problem, when the idea was to build a third place at the football club site or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago thought was given to setting up an artificial turf, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were launched two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube inheritance, promised a contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarized Klumpp.
The construction started on June 4th at the artificial turf square of 68 to 108 meters.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3000 cubic meters of the earth were discharged, half of which was used to set up a Dirt-Bike track.
Unknown women hurt girls by shot from car.
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
On Thursday evening in Ghenthin, the perpetrators probably fired a group of children with an air pressure weapon.
That was shared by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left side.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice has broken up.
They then drove away from it.
The criminal police were found, as was said on Friday.
Snowden is prepared to “cooperate” with Germany in relation to US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the U.S. secret service whistleblower, has said that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and stand before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about its activities.
The German MEP, Hans-Christian Ströbele, met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum was obtained to discuss with him what he said in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, he wrote: "If the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a fidelity breach and attempts to criminalise political expression.
To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community’s support can persuade the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges imposed by the US Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
The German interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said online about time: 'If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible'.
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the secret service parliamentary committee, said that you should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardising him completely and undermining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele declared that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden announces in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, the honourable Member says.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a “renewable and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a tribute to the public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, “if the problems surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved.”
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of clashes between influential personalities.
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear for the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothing for a t-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the White-led Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will revert to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could, in the next few years, bring more than $50 billion of investment from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Italy.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking on 17 October its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamos fortress.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, explained Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
In response to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as “the loser,” who wants to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he explained by saying that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to reopen negotiations, and to do so seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions that have been fuelled by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who bring the heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, will probably improve the election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what Renamo has capabilities, but it has undertaken rioting attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but which is located in Beira, which uses the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “the international community to warn that things are not going well in Mozambique,” said Mazanga.
Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, says that instability has increased frustration over the government, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction.
“The people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country’s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability.
"Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable roads," he explained.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof.
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short-lived scene.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, the scriptwriter and Hansjakobdar Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which was widely applauded under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman through the ten different scenes, explained connections and overwhelmed time jumps from the youth to the near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob will come home in his children's sky, in his Freihof.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again gleamed in his parade role as the great son of the city.
He performed in style with the two sperm and "Black Forest Frafts" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in mimics and gestures.
Between the various scenes, the Mühlenbacher Farm Chapel played selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
Then, in order to gain honor, Haslach’s mayor, Heinz Winkler, gave himself the honour of representing the then incumbent, Hättich, together with a part of the city council.
The three Kings singers who made Hansjakob's call, "Ah how beautiful, there are again memories of my own three-king era alive".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the open courtyard as well as the children of Storchen with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Church at the time, as did his concerns about the agricultural excesses, the consequences of industrialisation or the consequences of the war.
In his home town, behind his tomb chapel on the Brand near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A troubled spirit had finally found its quietness and had gone home forever," said at the end of the play of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
The Chinese newspaper is called to be "reformed" .
A Chinese newspaper, which called on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, was to be reformed, declared a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to falsify reports of a joint-state company.
Now the New Express is subjected to “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator declared.
The "Rection Order" was issued by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several untrue reports of the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express’s editorial management was unordered,” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a full retrace of the New Express, and has been recommended to identify the relevant Responses at the New Express and to immediately review the New Express’s management team.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then, Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports on pay.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he explained to the state news station CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was out of money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page and said that it failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were banned from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Lopening: Headers are still the only candidate.
Information on the Internet: Although the Baars town of Lopeningen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking policy on school, children, youth and senior citizens, and its own town works, has not yet been known as an attractive city candidate.
The 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Kahller from Lopeningen is the only candidate to succeed the mayor, who is no longer standing for age reasons.
The application deadline expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Lord draws attention.
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Gospel Church in Haigerloch, the town’s cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public theme tours on Sunday, 27th October, the Church of the Last Supper.
After the visit of the Atom Keller Museum, the Haigerlocher period was to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
A visit to the Church of Our Lady is the crowning conclusion.
There, the leaders get the story of building the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, there is also a view of Friedrich Schüz's "Christmas" paintings, created by Walter Kröll and Georg Halfritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one and a half hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atom Keller Museum.
Tickets are available at the A Atom Cellar Museum's cash desk.
The Tourist Office of the town of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Mick Jagger explained that he never attacked Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that "he had shoved me when I was 18".
She added: 'This was a long time ago and he was very nice to me'.
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he had ever made attempts at rapprochement with Katy Perry.”
The representative added: 'Because she confused him with someone else'.
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" came to the first place this week.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site.
The shady National Security Agency said late Friday that an error has paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spying agency in a notification sent by e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that for some users it is still not available.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was "not compromised in any way".
Secret information is not in danger, the speaker says.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the case of such attacks, the site will be flooded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system’s internal network.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (no such authority), now finds itself in the bright light of the public and sees itself after the sharp revelations of the NIS’s extensive surveillance program in recent months.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
Snowden could also say in Russia.
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in the US spy affair, including in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or even meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency in the name of unfamiliar circles who were familiar with the situation.
It was said that such an issue could be resolved intergovernmentally.
Snowden’s exit from Russia is virtually ruled out.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was an ally of the US, Snowden threatened to be extradited there, he continued to say.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the artus legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
Many myths, however, were “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland called for a “careful selection” of works according to age.
“I find it amazing that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “overly didactic,” children would be “shut down” because, in entertaining stories, the messages would be “understood” conveyed.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, explained: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background".
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be under-blown, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
You thought that travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes to be between $325 and 340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this will mean 12-17% growth compared to the record-high $290.4 million in the period 2011-12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in Australian and British private business.
“It is since the beginning of the year that our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on the way towards record-year income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest sources of income.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which compensated for a slightly weaker business market.
It was a similarly good deal for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while business customers were spending less here too.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year due to the season, so that for the third consecutive year a profit is expected for the full year.
Yesterday, the shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to $38.20.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings.
The new season at the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening we will continue with an Ü 25-party.
Fate beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organisers on both days.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays.
"We've got a lot of people who don't have noticed, the red points for Sunday emptying are still at various post boxes in the city and in the districts, but you can read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG soon.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether it is emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten even on Sunday, will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s question.
The German Social and Youth Speaker of the German Free Democratic Party, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important post service especially for appointments.
"This business is thinning out radically and unreasonable despite the increase in the prices of letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, Liberal Group and City Council chairman, supports his group colleagues: 'What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being changed or even deleted.'
The postal service is a mile-long distance from the citizens.
"The mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays", says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens, a mailbox with Sunday sleeves should also be able to reach within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning discussions with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge, there is also a Sunday shuffle in Hofheim.
Your party was in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other.
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actors Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, 'life sometimes does not run as we plan or hope it'.
Kerr and himself still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love one another as the parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and in 2011 their girlfriend Flynn was born.
Haslach – skepticism is increasingly defusing confidence.
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, basic changes will be made in the Haslach Maritime Sector (SE).
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The fundamental decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: skepticism about the new is slowly but steadily giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the new developments in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the volunteers of the Maritime Assistance Team were enough.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the newly defined guidelines for Seelbeing Units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE haslach, as a parish of the church, will in future form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six different parishes so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a council where the parish priest Kraft Office is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed.
Your task in the future will be to promote church life in the place.
When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The new features provide for the retention of accumulated funds in the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
There was a great deal of concern about the large planned investments, the obligation which all the parishes then meet.
"Auch in the past was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone", relative Haslach’s parish council chairman, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the Board in the Maritime Sector Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had set themselves the task of 'becoming one, staying five' and finding that this is not so easy.
The councils of the Haslach Maritime Care Unit then set out to answer questions on the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be fleshed out at further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelbeing Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne, who had to pay a 7% annual stamp tax on the housing in the 2012 budget, as well as for the buyer of two million individuals.
Already, income from the stamping tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in the 2012-13 tax year amounted to £708 million, outweigh the total revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Wales.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamping tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the legislation against evasion, it is difficult to say that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the old community tax system.
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s wealthy south-west belt stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a rising domestic market, where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east experienced so much a swelling (6.4%).
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball clergy.
The coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"I don't know how much a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reservation from Fredenbeck has not yet broken down trees, Malmon is raising the index finger in advance.
Many players have been trained in the A-Youth myself.
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their former coach.
The SG-coach also demonstrates that it is necessary to wait for reinforcement from the first one.
To return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Most importantly in the cover and the switching game, the last thing was huge.
There is also a definite need for better exploitation of opportunities.
So I hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
The US wants Snowden to continue to prosecute.
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of having unauthorisedly passed on secret information.
As a result, he must face criminal proceedings in the US, as the US State Department spokesman, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements would not change this either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele called on the US not to continue to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele’s remarks were about that of a parliamentarian, not that of a German member of the government.
Report: Obama’s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton.
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work about the 2012 “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times has a copy of the book that is about to be published, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had “closed group meetings and polls at the end of 2011,” to find out whether it would be better for Obama to re-election.
According to Jonathan Martin, the magazine’s national correspondent, the book accurately charts the history of the efforts of leading campaign staff and the White House, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact of former Secretary Clinton.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and the White House’s former senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – thought about the change.
"Double Down" argues that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden, despite their "enough, personal relationships," before Clinton finally decided against such a move after the candidacy showed.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government really thought of replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I made a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polling figures at that time, so we thought: 'For God's will, what do we do?'
While Daley called the investigation "protected diligence," Martin told CNN to Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was being made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a traction had been made with regard to that.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin explained to AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “conscious,” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about that.
Martin added that “double down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political screenings had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know of the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Made," Martin replied.
Local councillors are delighted with a sound budget.
Whenever local council meetings talk about the budget, mayor Ralph Gerster has good laughing.
The parish safari in Herdwangen-Schön is well filled and the administration has not known its debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this regard.
This was clear from the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than EUR 7.6 million than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, too, is about EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the community's share of income tax.
Once again, the wealth budget was well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than was planned, the repayment of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't just shake a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon cost the citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the community has in the past been able to forgo high levers.
According to Gerster, however, this has often cut back on subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory floors.
Among other things, the towns and communities that apply for subsidies must show certain strains.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting kits, because in the years to come we are facing investments for which we would like to receive subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the firming.
In two divine services, 101 15-year-old and 16-year-old youths have been confirmed by the Seelbeing Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning the church was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmware, the young people said yes to their baptism and took the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the last few months, the firmwares had prepared themselves for the big day, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many community members.
In different projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
A Obama Voter’s Desperation Wrong
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks.
Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School for the second year.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would calm me down during the foolish second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and describes Barack Obama’s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patients’ writings in the evening and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and was able to take his breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokespersons held to reflect the historic importance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama changed office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is a bad awakening, as if one is torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has indeed changed.
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army.
I, too, believe that the party-political blocking tactic has overturned too many efforts to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration on countless occasions to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end with my explanations.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are being intercepted or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why Whistleblowers are punished for revealing government wrongdoing.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, has been murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House’s efforts to retaliate the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if this is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood, at the age of 18, that the government’s work could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the Office of Representatives is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that troubles me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard so long ago.
But, with Obama’s approval ratings decreasing to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the tougher by this book.
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to inflict a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania pre-elections.
In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Constance: Blocking after accident on the sledge circle.
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat of Ibiza drove out of the city on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left bend track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved to the right lane.
This was a clash with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer, who was driving there.
The 19-year-old VW Passat, which runs behind the BMW, was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 material damage was created, and the police were involved.
The train had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive.
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, the managing director of the Stadtwerke, has confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will cost 70 to 90 Euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes.
These figures the additional costs incurred by the turn of energy, which they can charge by a levy above the price of electricity.
The town works Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the actual pay would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We are expecting an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be near the 2 cents.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing his childhood and youth from his soul.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - languagelessness, the inclination to brute force and blunt sexuality.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as prose-author, and theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts for his performance "weather luminosities on the Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically shaped novel "Der Leibow" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family grieved" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisit: a cute couch on which it is connotated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
In doing so, director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overtakes the template with a wealth of directional inputs, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
In particular, the actresses have come to the fore in the sometimes somewhat questionable staged implementations.
They are strongly attacked, dived under water with their head, hacked to the wall with their evening trenches.
Insulated in cellophane or mieder, they stalk on dangerously high poles through the staging, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous manner.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk song.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and Winkler’s downright absurd humour shines.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giant grows.
The chances of remaining the leagues of the sportyly lost Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball team have increased.
For if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now less competition for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible postbacker place.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept of a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, the first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is established that Düsseldorf does not receive a licence," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, entrants can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic Bundesliga suit.
So far, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
